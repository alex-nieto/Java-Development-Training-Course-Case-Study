<h2>About QueerGuard</h2>

<p>
QueerGuard is a review site built for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>
It is a site where the community can find LGBTQ+ safe companies <br>
and hear from other's experiences. Companies are set as safe and <br>
given rating of how safe they are based on reviews made by <br>
customers like you. You may also find some companies that advocate<br>
as allies by declaring themselves LGBTQ+ safe.
</p>

<p>
This site was built for the sole purpose of supporting the LGBTQ+ <br>
community and helping the community to feel safe wherever they go.
